# 🎯 Project Title: Netflix Data Analysis & Personalized Recommendation System using SVD (scikit-surprise) 🎬📈

# 🧠 Overview:
Over an immersive 3-day project, I worked with a massive Netflix dataset containing crores of data points, including user ratings, movie details, and interaction histories. This project focused on data analysis and building a recommendation system that mimics how streaming platforms like Netflix understand and predict user preferences using Machine Learning.

# 📊 Project Highlights:

-- ✅ Data Handling & Integration:

Merged and managed two large-scale datasets: one containing detailed user-movie rating logs, and the other with metadata like titles, genres, and release years.

Implemented memory optimization techniques to handle the volume efficiently.

-- 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Uncovered key insights into user behavior, genre popularity, temporal viewing patterns, and rating distributions.

Used visualization tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib to narrate data stories effectively.

-- 🛠️ Feature Engineering:

Processed timestamps to extract year-wise trends and user activity timelines.

Encoded categorical variables and ensured data consistency before model training.

-- 🤖 Model Development: Collaborative Filtering using SVD

Employed Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) from the scikit-surprise library to build a personalized recommender system.

The model was trained on partial user ratings — users had rated some movies, but not all — and it learned hidden patterns in the user-item interaction matrix.

-- ✨ How It Works:

The model predicts how a user might rate unseen movies by identifying latent factors in user preferences and movie characteristics.

Based on these estimated ratings, the system can recommend movies that align with the user’s taste.

-- 📌 Results & Takeaways:

Delivered accurate movie predictions using collaborative filtering without content-based features.

Gained deep insight into how platforms like Netflix provide personalized suggestions to millions of users.

Enhanced my skills in data preprocessing, matrix factorization, and scalable ML deployment. 

-- 🧰 Tech Stack Used:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-surprise, Jupyter Notebook


# 💬 Final Thoughts:
This project was a powerful blend of big data handling, behavioral analysis, and machine learning, closely aligned with real-world recommender systems. It helped sharpen my ability to solve user-centric problems at scale — a critical skill in today’s data-driven product environments.
